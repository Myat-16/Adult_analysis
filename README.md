### Approaches
1. utilized the public Kaggle dataset to explore  What is the average age of men?
What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K.
2. Columns that I used are age, workclass, education, marital_stu, occupation, relationship, races, sex, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country, income. 
3. Columns that I used for this analysis are Customers_ID,TotalPrice,SalePersonID,CityID and HiredDate
4. Cleaned and processed millions of rows in Python
