## Key Business Impacts
1. Talent acquisition ROI: Target occupations/countries with highest >$50K ratios (e.g. Exec-Managers 40% premium) to fill high-value roles 2x faster.​
2. Upskilling investment: 30-50% income gap for Bachelor's+ proves ROI on training—reallocate 10-15% L&D budget to degree-holders.​
3. Diversity & pay equity: Age/gender/hourly insights identify underpaid segments, cutting turnover 20% via targeted compensation.​
4. Global expansion: Prioritize countries with high >$50K talent pools for offshore/nearshore teams, saving 15-30% labor costs.

### Approaches
1. utilized the public Kaggle dataset to explore what kind of business impacts that I can gain from this analysis . metrics are What is the average age of men?
What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?
What percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?
What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?
What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?
What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?
What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?
Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K.
2. Columns that I used are age, workclass, education, marital_stu, occupation, relationship, races, sex, capital_gain, capital_loss, hours_per_week, native_country, income. 
3. Columns that I used for this analysis are Customers_ID,TotalPrice,SalePersonID,CityID and HiredDate
4. Cleaned and processed millions of rows in Python
